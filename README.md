InspireMe is a watchface that also acts as a motivator or demotivator for the user. 

Its use cases are pretty general: if a person is having a really rough day, for example, has a hackathon project that falls to crumbles at 2am, 8 hours before it's due, they can click the up button to recieve an API-generated inspirational quote. It is guaranteed to motivate.

As for the other spectrums, InspireMe is also designed for those who are stuck-up and believe themselves to be the absolute best. For them, the down button comes into play, which shoots insults at them until their egotisitical personality can't handle it anymore. 

Enjoy!
